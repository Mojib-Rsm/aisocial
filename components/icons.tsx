// This is a placeholder file.
// For this project, we will use icons directly from the `lucide-react` library
// as shown in the components. This avoids duplicating SVG code and ensures
// access to a wide, consistent set of high-quality icons.

// Example usage in a component:
// import { Zap } from 'lucide-react';
// const MyComponent = () => <Zap color="orange" size={24} />;

// This approach is more maintainable and scalable than managing individual icon files.
// Please ensure `lucide-react` is added as a dependency in a real project environment.
// For this single-file generation, the import statements in the components are sufficient
// to indicate the dependency.
